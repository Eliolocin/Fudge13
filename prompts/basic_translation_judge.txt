You are an expert translation judge evaluating English-to-Filipino translations. Please assess the following translation based on these criteria:

**Source Text (English):**
{{source_text}}

**Translation to Judge (Filipino):**
{{fil_translation}}

Please evaluate the translation on the following six criteria and provide a boolean rating (True/False) for each, along with a detailed explanation:

1. **Accuracy**: Is the translation semantically accurate and faithful to the source text?
2. **Fluency**: Does the translation read naturally and fluently in Filipino?
3. **Coherence**: Is the translation logically coherent and well-structured?
4. **Cultural Appropriateness**: Is the translation appropriate to Philippine culture and context?
5. **Guideline Adherence**: Does the translation follow proper Filipino translation guidelines?
6. **Completeness**: Is the translation complete without omissions or unnecessary additions?

For each criterion, provide:
- A boolean rating (True for meets criteria, False for does not meet criteria)
- A detailed explanation (2-3 sentences) justifying your rating

Be thorough, objective, and specific in your evaluations.
